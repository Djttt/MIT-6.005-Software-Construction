When fleeting time with silent foot doth tread,
And steals the blush from off my tender cheek,
Each hour a thief that leaves my beauty dead,
And makes the strength of former days grow weak

Yet still thy love, like sun that warms the spring,
Restores the bloom time seeks to take away;
No frost can mar what thou to me dost bring,
Nor night consume the light of thy bright ray.

Though wrinkles line the canvas of my brow,
And silver threads entwine my raven hair,
Thy gaze still sees what once I was, and how
Thy heart unchanged makes all my age seem fair.

So let time turn the page and write its part,
While thou keep'st youth immortal in thy heart.
